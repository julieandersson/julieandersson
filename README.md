# Hi!

My name is Julie Andersson, I am 23 years old, and I come from Sweden. This year, I started studying web development,
and I'm very happy with that decision. I've actually never done anything similar before, so everything is completely new to me.
However, I'm learning, and it becoms more enjoyable and easier with each passing day!

At the moment, we are learning about JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which is very interesting. I'm looking forward to
the next two years, and I truly hope and believe that I will become a great web developer in the future.
